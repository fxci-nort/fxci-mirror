          <p>
            12.2.2. The balance has no relation to real funds; it is only a virtual representation

            activities adhere to appropriate simulated loss limits.

            12.5. For the purpose of assessment accounts on the website, the standard account
            leverage of 1:100 is used for test trading of FX instruments. The provider reserves the

          <p>
            13.6. If the Trading Targets are not met, participants have the option to retake the

            under the same conditions.

            13.7. Successful completion of 3 Assessments (transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2,
            transition from Phase 2 to Final evaluation by the Provider) may result in the
            participant being invited to become a FXCI EXPERT. This means that the participant may
            be offered a contract to provide consulting services to the Provider or a partner
            company. Such an agreement falls outside the regulations of these Terms and Conditions
            and constitutes a separate agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            13.8. The Provider reserves the right to accept or refuse to recognize a participant as
            a FXCI EXPERT at its discretion and is not obligated to disclose the reasons for such a
            decision.
          </p>

            13.10. The Provider’s decision regarding the successful or unsuccessful completion of
            the Assessments is final and not subject to appeal. The decision can only be
            reconsidered at the Provider’s initiative.
          </p>
          <p>
            13.10. In the event of unsuccessful completion of the assessment, if the participant
            decides to discontinue cooperation, or if the Provider decides not to recognize the
            participant as a FXCI EXPERT, the participant is not entitled to a refund of the funds
            spent on access to Challenges or any other refunds.

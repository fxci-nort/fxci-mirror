          </p>
          <p style={{ paddingLeft: '40px' }}>

            overview of our refund process:

              <span className="">support@fxci.com</span>

          </p>
          <p style={{ paddingLeft: '40px' }}>
            5.1.2. Review and Decision. Upon receiving a refund request, our dedicated refunds team
            will review the request and assess its validity based on the eligibility criteria set
            forth in our Refunds Policy. This may involve requesting additional information or
            documentation from the customer.
          </p>
          <p style={{ paddingLeft: '40px' }}>
            5.1.3. Notification about the decision. We will promptly notify the customer of the
            outcome of their refund request. This notification may include whether the request has
            been approved or denied, along with any relevant details or explanations.
          </p>
          <p style={{ paddingLeft: '40px' }}>
            5.1.4. If the Refund is approved, we will proceed with the refund process. The timing
            and method of refund disbursement will typically align with the terms specified in our
            Refunds Policy.
          </p>
          <p style={{ paddingLeft: '40px' }}>
            5.1.5. If the Refund is denied, the request does not meet the eligibility criteria or if
            there are other valid reasons for denial, we may provide a clear explanation to the
            customer regarding the decision. The decision regarding the refund is final and not
            subject to appeal.

            as necessary to ensure a clear understanding of the process and the status of their
            request. At the same time, the refund process can be complicated as the decision may
            depend on various factors, including the Provider’s partners (Third parties). In such a
            case, the answers can be provided after the decision of the third parties and/or
            information from them.

            the confirmation of substandard service. You accept that the total refund period depends
            on the Provider’s (Third party) payment service provider.

          <h2 className="h2-border">6. Exclusions</h2>
          <p>
            6.1. Refunds are not applicable to transactions or purchases that do not meet the

            beyond our control and are considered force majeure events. Such events may include
            natural disasters, acts of terrorism, or other unforeseen and uncontrollable incidents.

          </p>
          <h2 className="h2-border">8. Changes to this Refund Policy</h2>
          <p>
            8.1. The Provider reserves the right to modify or update this Refund Policy at any time
            without prior notice. Changes will become effective upon posting on the Website or
            through other communication channels. It is your responsibility to review this Refund

          </p>
          <h2 className="h2-border">9. Chargebacks</h2>
          <p>
            9.1. A chargeback is a process that allows a customer to dispute a transaction made
            through their payment card issuer. While we are committed to addressing refund requests
            through our established refund process (as outlined in our Refunds Policy), customers
            should be aware of the following important considerations related to chargebacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            9.2. We strongly encourage customers to contact our customer support team and utilize
            our internal dispute resolution procedures to address any issues or concerns related to
            a transaction before initiating a chargeback. Please contact us first.
          </p>
          <p>
            9.3. A chargeback should generally be considered a last method when all other attempts
            to resolve a dispute have been exhausted. Initiating a chargeback without prior
            communication may delay the resolution process.
          </p>
          <p>
            9.4. It is important to be aware that initiating a chargeback without the prior
            notification may have consequences, including the potential suspension or termination of
            your account or access to our services in accordance with our Terms and Conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            9.5. Chargebacks may involve associated fees or costs imposed by payment card issuers or
            financial institutions. Customers should be aware of these potential costs before
            proceeding with a chargeback.
          </p>
          <p>
            9.6. In the event that any fees are charged to the Provider for a Chargeback without the
            initial notification, the Client agrees to compensate for it in the prescribed manner.
          </p>
